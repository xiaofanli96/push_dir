Part of your score on the homework will be if you get the \"right\" answer, but also if there is a clear effort and if some (if not all) of the right steps are taken towards the correct solution. In order for us to understand what you've written, you need to have clearly written code. Documenting your code with comments (# sign) and spacing out your code (but not too much) makes it easier to read. This also allows us to see clearly that you know what you are doing, rather than just typing down a certain piece of code because lecture said so.\n",
